# Transcriptomic and Metabolomic Response to High Light in the Charophyte Alga *Klebsormidium nitens*.

This repository contains all the bioinformatics codes used for the realization of the TFM: **Transcriptomic and Metabolomic Response to High Light in the Charophyte Alga Klebsormidium nitens.**. They are mainly divided into two blocks according to the omics under study and the biological validation used:

- **Transcriptomic**. This folder contains all the analyses related to the study of *Klebsormidium nitens* RNA under high light (HL) stress. These include:

  - **MARACAs**. Results generated by the MARACAS software for the Klebsormidium nitens species under high light intensity for 3 hours. Outstanding among these are... 
  
  - **RNAseq**. Downstream RNAseq pipeline including a global transcriptomic statistics, differential gene expression analysis and a specific gene analysis for interesting pathways.

  - **EnrichGO**. GO term enrichment for activated and repressed genes based on *Arabidopsis thaliana* orthology.

  - **Saturation_Study**. To demonstrate that using 2 replicates in this RNAseq study was sufficient, a saturation study was performed for both genome coverage and DEGs starting from different numbers of reads. In addition, a saturation study performed on an analogous *K. nitens* study performed with 3 replicates was included.
