# Transcriptomic and Metabolomic Response to High Light in the Charophyte Alga Klebsormidium nitens.

This repository contains all the bioinformatics codes used for the realization of the TFM: **Transcriptomic and Metabolomic Response to High Light in the Charophyte Alga Klebsormidium nitens.**. They are mainly divided into two blocks according to the omics under study: 

- **Transcriptomic**. This folder contains all the analyses related to the study of *Klebsormidium nitens* RNA under high light (HL) stress. These include:
  - **MARACAs**.
  - **RNASEQ**.
  - **EnrichGO**.
  - **Saturation_Study**.

- **Metabolomic**.
